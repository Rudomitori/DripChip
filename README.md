### What does this repo contain?
A solution to ["If...else" olympiad](https://challenge.braim.org/it-planet/simbirsoft.html)
that was held in 2023.
It's not complete and won't be because during
the olympiad the event organizers added new unreasonable restrictions on technologies that can be used
and I lost any interest to this olympiad.

You can see the tasks in [docs folder](/docs).
The solution covers stage 1 and 0-th step of stage 2.
